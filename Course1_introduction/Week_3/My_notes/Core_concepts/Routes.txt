##### How routing works #########

1. idea of routing: before the controller can orchestrate where the request goes - the web request nedd to get routed to the controller

2. routes for hello action is automatically generated (when rails g controller)

3.MVC Cycle
	- Request sent (request comes to app, if sattic file --> public 				folder, find the file, othrewise go to next)
	- Router routes request to the controller (action)
	- Controller <-> model(db)
	- Contoller invokes View
	- View randers data

4. All routes need to be specified manually except the first automatically generated in the config/routes.rb

### What is Rake ################

1. Ruby 's build language
	- Ruby's make (make from C)
	- No XML - written in Ruby (make file is written in XML)
2. Rails uses rake to autoate app-related tasks
	- Database, running tests, etc

####### How to analyze your current route #########

1. To see a list of rake tasks for your app (what your rake supports)
	- cmd: rake --tasks 
2. Zero-in on an individual rake task and what it does with a --describe flag
	- cmd: rake --describe task_name
	- cmd: rake --describe routes
	- cmd: rake routes

---> GIVE YOU : variable name, URL pattern(diff format files), controller# actions


Summary
1. Router directs request to the right controller
2. rake  routes: what routes are current defined for your application
