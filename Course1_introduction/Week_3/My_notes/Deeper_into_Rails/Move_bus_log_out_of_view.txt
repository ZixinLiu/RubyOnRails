#### how to move business logic (商业规则， 业务逻辑) out of view and into controller in order to comply(遵从) with CMV pattern ###########

1. if the action (method) is not really doing anything(empty), remove it

2. As long as there is a proper route defined and there is a properly nmaed view file/template, the action method does not have to be there and Rails will find the correct template by convention

3. Comment out def hello, def goodbye in the controller

4. Our app "work", but business logic does not belong in the View, the view should contain as little ruby code as possible ---> logic should go to controller


######## How long the controller's instance variables stay in place######

1. With the new controller and view, we found that the number viewed always be 1, why?

2. Unlike other framework, you cannot store values in the controller's instance variables in between requests.

3. Every new request, it create a new instance variable

4 Alternatives??
	- http session
	- database



Summary
1. keep business logic out of view
2. instance variable in the controller is available to the view
3. instance variable don't stick around in between requests
